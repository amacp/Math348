# Syllabus
## Overview
Modeling of real-life systems as Markov chains, including transient
behaviour, limiting behaviour and classification of states, and using the exponential distribution and Poisson processes. Computational topics include generating and sampling random numbers, combinatorial objects and probability functions. Applications may include queuing systems, chemical kinetics, infectious diseases, and statistical physics.

**Prerequisite:** STAT 270 and (MATH 232 or MATH 240), all with a minimum grade of C-.

*Strongly Recommended:* Experience with a computing platform such as R, MATLAB, or Python.

## Liearning Objectives

- Define key terms and concepts in probability.
- Use probability rules to answer biological questions.
- Simulate random numbers from probability distributions and use these simulations. 
- Develop a stochastic process describe phenomena in the natural world.
- Mathematically analyze a stochastic process 
- Draw biological conclusions and interpretations from stochastic processes.
- Develop, code, and execute simulations of biological phenomena
- Analyze simulation results and draw biological conclusions
- Propose likelihood functions for inferring  parameters of biological models.

## Grading Scheme

| **Component** | **Weight** |
|---------------|------------|
| Homework*     | 30%       |
| Midterm†      | 20%       |
| Project       | 20%       |
| Final†        | 30%       |

Project will involve developing and analyzing a stochastic or simulation-based model for a given biological system. Students will receive an introduction to the biological process and focal questions to addressed. Using methods covered in the course you will then be required to propose a model to address the given questions, analyze the model, and write a 2pg report summarizing their approach and findings.

*You are encouraged to use chatGPT or AI to assist in your homework. If you use chatGPT, you are required to submit a log of the conversation with your assignment. Note that the responses provided by chatGPT may be wrong either entirely or in part, it is your responsibility to ensure that responses provided are correct and satisfy the assignment.  

†chatGPT will not be available for use during in class exams.  Please keep this in mind when self-assessing your understanding of core course concepts in the homework assignments.

You can recieve up to 5% bonus marks for tutorial and lecture attendance.

### Homework Assignments

Weekly homework assignments are due on **Sunday at 11:59pm**.  There will be a 25% late penalty for every non-excused day late.

There will be 11 assignments with 3% each with the lowest score dropped for a total of 30% of the grade. Homework solutions should be returned in a single typset pdf file.  I recommend using either 1) Latex (.tex file), 2) Markdown (.md file), or 3) a python mardkown file.  To recieve full credit you must show your work.  Please name your file in the following manner `[Assignment#]_[name]_[student ID].pdf` (e.g., `Assignment1_JuanDoe_12345678.pdf`). If you use chatGPT or other AI chat engine to complete your assignment, please include the corresponding chat log as an appendix to your pdf.

## Diversity and Inclusion Statement

In this course you will treat others and be treated with respect. We welcome individuals of all ages, backgrounds, beliefs, ethnicities, genders, orientations, national origins, abilities, and other visible and non-visible differences. All members of this course are expected to contribute respectfully and in return each contribution will be appreciated and treated with respect.

## Academic Integrity

All members of the university are expected to uphold the values of academic integrity: honesty, trust, fairness, respect, responsibility, and courage. SFU considers any act of falsification, misrepresentation or deception to be destructive because it is unfair to students who pursue their studies honestly, it compromises the worth of other’s work, and ultimately prevents students from meaningfully reaching their own scholarly potential.

Being an SFU student means you belong to a scholarly community where you will develop the critical thinking and research skills to not only be job ready but life ready. The satisfaction of a degree earned through hard work and persistence is a prize that is profoundly meaningful and universally respected.

**AI and chatGPT in this course**: the use of AI will be central to this course.  It will allow us put aside the busy work to focus on the fundamentals.  It is your responsibility to 1) design the *prompts*, 2) implement the *completions*, 3) and validate the results.
